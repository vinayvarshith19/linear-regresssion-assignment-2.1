# Linear Regression for IoT

Although linear regression is not as flashy as neural network based ML applications, it can often still do a decent job of creating simple predictions for streaming data. Linear regression also has the major benefit for IoT applications of being very lightweight and quick to run--this means that a linear regression based model could potentially be run on the edge network and have lower latency for sending signals to local devices. In this assignment you will use the electricity consumption dataset from Module 1 to predict global active power based on simulated streaming data. You will explore different parameters and model inputs and analyze the effect that they have on the model performance.

### Instructions: 

1. Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: https://github.com/amarbut/aai-iot-linear-regression. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make your repository [private](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility) and add your instructorâ€™s Github account as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 

2. Following the instructions in the jupyter notebook from the above Github template, build several linear regression models to predict Global Active Power on simulated streaming data.

3. Answer all questions as prompted in the jupyter notebook to analyze the performance of your models and the effects that changing model parameters and data inputs have on the predictions.
