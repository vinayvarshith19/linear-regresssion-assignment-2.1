    "This notebook holds the Assignment 3.1 for Module 3 in AAI 530, Data Analytics and the Internet of Things. In this assignment, you will use linear regression to make predictions for simulated \"streaming\" data. The work that you do in this assignment will build on the linear regression predictions that you saw in your text book and in this week's lab session. Be sure to answer the analysis questions thoroughly, as this is a large part of the assignment for this week.\n",
